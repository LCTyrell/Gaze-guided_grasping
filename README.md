# Gaze-guided grasping for wheelchair-mounted robotic arm

![Pres](Utils/WMRA_pres.jpg)

Recent advances in AI are leading to major advances in robotics that will benefit service and assistance to people.

The new capabilities of robotics will improve the quality of life of many disabled people and more particularly those with severe disabilities.

Wheelchairs will become more and more robotic with the ability to navigate autonomously, open doors, grab objects, give people with severe disabilities the ability to eat on their own, ... in a nutshell, giving more autonomy to people with tetraplegia, which represents more than 100,000 people in the United States alone (NSCISC data, 2018).

There are already robotic arms mounted on wheelchairs that partially quadriplegic people can use more or less easily (the brain interface remains mainly in the field of research at this time). But using a robotic arm is not simple and requires constant attention. Unlike able-bodied people for whom the gesture is mostly done unconsciously (you don't have to think about how to open your hand to grab an object, or think about the precise movement to reach it).

As part of this challenge, we propose to develop a gaze-guided grasping for wheelchair mounted robotic arm to free the user from the complex manipulation and constant attention required for the use of the arm and thus improve the ease of use. More precisely, we offer assistance in reaching the objects, the final grasping phase being always a subject of research and we want to offer an immediately feasible solution.

## Method

### Object Looked Estimation model  

For this objective, we will use two OAK-D (a limited POC can be done with one OAK-D), one directed in front of the user to estimate the direction of his gaze and determine the coordinates of his eyes (x, y, z ) and one in the opposite direction to detect the object in front of the user and their positions.

The Gaze Estimation model comes from Intel Openvino. The implementation on NCS2 by the single member of the LCT Robocare team has been ported to DepthAI by the Luxonis team. The NCS2 implementation can be found on Github here:  
[https://github.com/LCTyrell/Gaze_estimation](https://github.com/LCTyrell/Gaze_estimation)

The coordinates (x, y) and depth (z) position of the eyes will be determined using the stereo depth capability of the OAK-D and the landmark detection model already used as part of the gaze estimation model.

Object detection with depth coordinates was a feature implemented very early by the Luxonis team and one of the reasons for the success of the OAK-D. It output bounding boxes, from the detected objects, located in space (x, y, z).

Afterward the two coordinate systems of the two OAK-Ds can be combined into one coordinate system. And then we can detect if the gaze direction intercepts any of the detected objects.

Finally, we can send the coordinates to a robotic arm, to reach the object, with a “classic” inverse kinematic algorithm.

### Robotic Arm

Although this project is focused on creating the “Object Looked Estimation” model, if time permits, we will be doing a demo with a robotic arm on a simulation (Unity), and/or an inexpensive educational robotic arm (Poppy Ergo Jr). Both are ROS compatible.

#### Unity ML-Agents

Preliminary tests have been carried out on the Unity ML-Agents robotic platform. (Adaptation of the Unity Robotics Demos : [https://github.com/LCTyrell/articulations-robot-demo](https://github.com/LCTyrell/articulations-robot-demo) )  
The simulation allows you to quickly test many camera positions and the effect of different camera focal lengths.
In addition, ML agents allow training neural networks to reach / grab an object. This method, unlike reverse kinematics, makes it possible to use less precise motors and therefore drastically reduce the price of the robotic arm used for this type of task.
It's not part of the competition, but an interesting path to follow afterwards.

The prohibitive price of robotic arms (and even more specialized arms) forces us to find an alternative solution to test the model. So we chose the Ergo Jr robotic arm, which is inexpensive but has a long-standing community and relatively good features for a preliminary POC.

## Conclusion

This project is part of a larger reflection on robotic wheelchairs where the OAK-D or a variant could play a role: autonomous navigation, gaze-guided pointer controller for additional device, surveillance and security alert, collision avoidance...  

But if we want all of this to really benefit as many people as possible, then the price of robotic technology must be lowered. From this perspective, the use of neural networks instead of kinematics, gives hope for the possibility of using robotic arms that are less precise but more adaptable and therefore less expensive. By lowering the price of Stereo-Depth + AI integration, and by opensourcing its boards, Luxonis-DepthAI products are also moving in this direction.
